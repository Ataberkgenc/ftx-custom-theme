# FTX Custom Theme

### Install

This user script can be installed directly from https://openuserjs.org/scripts/TraderSamwise/FTX_Custom_Theme. You must use something like TamperMonkey to run user scripts on Chromium based browsers.

### About

Script to customize the theme of FTX.com as well as display PNL in BTC. By default the script only activates on `/trade` pages but because react uses a virtual router it only knows the first page loaded on FTX.com, so you have to either go straight to a `/trade` path or reload once you get there.

Code is completely open source but I make no guarantees that it will work or be maintained. Use at your own discretion and feel free to submit pull requests.
